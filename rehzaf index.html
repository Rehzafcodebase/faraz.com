    <h1>🧍‍♂️ About Me</h1>
     <p>My name is <b>Faraz Ahmad</b>, and I come from a small town near <strong>Bhagsar , Pakistan.</strong>
Since my early school days, I have always been curious about technology — especially computers and how they work.
After completing  my <strong> 12th-grade exams,</strong>  I was eager to step into the world of computer skills and explore something new.
<br>
Originally, we had planned to leave right after our final exams, but because of our <strong>computer practical exams,</strong> our plans got delayed by almost a month.
Finally, on <strong> 8th July 2025,</strong>  we began our journey — a journey full of excitement, curiosity, and new beginnings.
That day marked the start of something special — the day I took my first step toward learning computer skills.</p>
<h2>"One Day — The Beginning of My Journey ( July 08,2025)</h2>
    <h3>🏠 Leaving Home</h3>
    <p>It was the first time in my life that I was leaving home to learn computer skills. I was very excited and happy inside, filled with curiosity about what awaited me ahead.
<br>
That morning, around <strong>10 o’clock,</strong> my <strong> mother</strong> helped me pack my clothes into a small bag. After packing, I placed the bag near the door, ready to leave. By<strong> 11 a.m.,</strong> I had taken a bath and got myself ready. I kept going outside again and again — waiting, walking around the street, and coming back home — the excitement just wouldn’t let me sit still.
<br>
Finally, around <strong>12:30 p.m.,</strong> I left home with my two friends, <b>Noman</b> and <b>Hamid.</b> Together, we went to <b>Kotli Hasan Shah,</b> from where I boarded a wagon and traveled towards <b>Bangla Hidayat.</b>  From there, we hired another ride to reach <b>Kot Mitthan.</b>  
<br><h3>🚌 The Road To Multan</h3>
At Kot Mitthan, we bought our tickets for <b>Faisal Mor (Multan).</b>  The ticket seller told us that the bus would take about an hour to arrive, so we decided to pray  <b>Zuhr (noon) prayer</b> at the nearby mosque. After that, we had some time left, so we went to a park, sat there for a while, and enjoyed the peaceful atmosphere.
<br>
When the time came, we returned to the station and waited. Finally, our bus — <b>Euro (Yaro)</b> — arrived. We boarded it and began our journey. Along the way, we saw many new places for the first time, including the famous <b>CPEC road.</b>  It was a thrilling experience — full of excitement, wonder, and joy. By evening, we finally reached <b>Multan,</b>  tired but filled with unforgettable memories of our first journey.</p>
<h3>🌇 Evenig in Multan</h3>
<p>By <b>6 p.m.,</b>  we finally reached <b>Multan.</b> After getting off the bus, we planned to go to <b>Cantt (Cantonment area),</b> where a friend of ours named <b>Khalil</b>  had promised to help us find a place to stay.
<br>
Khalil told us that he would arrange a small house for us to live in. We then talked to a rickshaw driver, but he asked for a very high fare. Because of that, we decided not to go there right away. For a while, we became a bit confused and didn’t know what to do next.
<br>
We were standing near <b>Vehari Chowk,</b>  close to the  <b>Metro Station </b>in Multan. It was a busy place, surrounded by buses and travelers from different cities of Pakistan. As the sun began to set, we performed our <b>Maghrib prayer</b>  there and sat quietly, thinking about what to do next.
<br>
Even though we were tired and a bit uncertain, there was still a feeling of adventure in our hearts — the excitement of being in a new city for the first time.</p>
<p><h3>🕌 Maghrib Prayer,</h3>After offering the  <b>Maghrib prayer,</b> we sat for a while at the <b>Vehari Chowk bus terminal,</b>  resting and thinking about where to go next. <br>
Just then, I received a call from my elder brother, <b>Shahzad Ahmad</b> He asked, “Have you found a place to stay yet?”
I told him that we hadn’t found any place so far. He suggested, “You should go to <b>Chungi No. 6;</b>  you might find something there.”
<br>
So, we decided to head towards <b>Chungi No. 6.</b> 
On the way, we stopped at a <b>hotel (tea shop)</b>  to have some tea because we were feeling tired from the journey.
When we asked for tea, the waiter told us it was <b>70 rupees per cup.</b> <br>
We were surprised — in our hometown, tea was much cheaper!
It felt strange and a bit funny, realizing how different prices were in a big city compared to our small town.
<br>
We each ordered a cup of tea forb <b>50 rupees</b>  and enjoyed the warmth and taste that refreshed us after the long day.
<h3>🚉 Metro Bus Ride</h3>
After finishing, we walked towards the <b>Metro Station.</b> 
I had already heard about the  <b>Multan Metro Bus,</b> and I was very eager to see it and ride it for the first time.
<br>
We bought our tickets and boarded the metro.
It felt amazing — smooth, modern, and fast.
As the bus moved through the shining city lights of Multan, I felt proud and excited.
It was my  <b>first time traveling by metro,</b> and I enjoyed every moment of it.</p><h3>🚉 Finding the Right Station</h3>
<p>As we were traveling on the Metro Bus, we honestly had <b>no clear idea</b>  where exactly we were going.
All we knew was that we had to reach <b>Chungi No. 6,</b>  but we didn’t know which stop it would be.
So, we kept asking passengers around us, “Which station is this?” or “Is Chungi No. 6 coming next?”
<br>
Each time, someone would mention a different stop name, and we kept waiting — passing one station after another.
By the time we finally heard someone say, “This is Chungi No. 6 Station!”<br>
we had already passed around <b>ten stations</b> without realizing how far we’d come.
<br>
We quickly stood up, smiled at each other, and got ready to get off the bus.<br>
When the metro stopped, we stepped outside and finally entered the <b>Chungi No. 6 Station,</b> </p>
<h3>🛣️ Arrival at Chungi No. 6 – The Confusion</h3>
<p>When we finally got off at <b>Chungi No. 6 Metro Station,</b> we didn’t realize that the station was actually <b>located inside the Gulgasht Colony.</b> <br>
We were supposed to exit from the left side, but unknowingly, we got off from the <b> right side</b> instead.
<br>
At that moment, we had no idea where exactly we needed to go.
My brother had mentioned that our destination was near <b>“Chase Up Shopping Mall”,</b>  but we didn’t know whether it was on the left or right side of the road.
So, we kept walking on the wrong side, looking around for signs or directions.<br>

A few minutes later, my brother <b>Shahzad Ahmad</b>  called again.
He said, “You’re almost there — it’s just a one or two–minute walk.<br>
You’ll see a board that says <b>‘Chase Up Shopping Mall’</b>  — that’s the place. Go downstairs from there.”
</p>
<h3>🚦 Crossing the Double Road – A Funny Moment</h3>
<p>There was a  <b>double road</b> — one side for vehicles going forward and the other for those coming back.
We were standing on one side of the road, and right across from us was the <b>Chase Up Shopping Mall.</b>
<br>
I told my friends, “My brother said we have to go under Cheez Up!”
At this, my friend  <b>Noman,</b> jokingly replied,
<br>
“We don’t need to go under Chase Up — I might end up going under a car instead!”
<br>
We all laughed loudly at his words.
After a few moments, our friend  <b>Hamid</b> crossed the road first.
Then, slowly and carefully, I also crossed to the other side.
<br>
But <b>Noman</b>  stayed back — he waited almost <b>15 minutes</b>  before finally crossing!
At first, we waited for him for about five minutes, but when we saw he was still scared to cross, we couldn’t stop laughing.
<br>
Eventually, he gathered courage, ran across safely, and joined us on the other side.
Finally, we stood together <b> under the Chase Up Plaza,</b></p><h3>🏠 The End of the Day – Reaching the Room</h3>
<p>As we stood under the bright <b>Chase Up board</b>
a young man approached us.
He was a <b>friend of Sabri,</b> friend of Sabri, who was my brother’s friend.
We were actually supposed to go to <b>Sabri’s room,</b>
so when he asked, “Are you guys from Umerkot?”
we replied, “Yes, we are.”
<br>
He smiled and said,
<br>
“Come with me, I’ll show you the room.”
<br>
At first, we were a little doubtful —
new city, new faces, everything unfamiliar.
But we decided to follow him.
He led us upstairs to the <b>fourth floor,</b>
where his room was located.
<br>
He opened the door and said warmly,
<br>
“Please, sit here and relax.”
<br>
We finally sat down,
tired but happly — relieved that our long day’s journey had safely ended.<br>
It was the <b>first day of a new chapter</b>  in our lives —
a day full of laughter, confusion, and unforgettable memories</p><br>
